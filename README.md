# Password Generator 
https://jermz678.github.io/password-generator/
## Here I have built a password generator using Javascript. I created multiple arrays, ifs, and while statements to achieve this.
### I take the user's input, such as how many characters (8-128), and whether they want to use capital letters, small letters, numbers and symbols.
### If user chooses n for no for all choices, password can not be generated and an alert asks them to try again.
### User can answer questions with lowercase or uppercase letters.  If input is not what is asked, it will ask again.
### Have fun making passwords!
